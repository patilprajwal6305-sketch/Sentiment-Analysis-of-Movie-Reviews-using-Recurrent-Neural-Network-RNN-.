# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Movie-Reviews-using-Recurrent-Neural-Network-RNN-.
This project builds a sentiment analysis model that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It processes text through preprocessing and embedding, then predicts user sentiment using deep learning and natural language processing techniques.
